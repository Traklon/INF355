-- Introduction of Qubits.
--
-- In quantum computing, Bits are replaced with Qubits.
-- They can be in state |0> or |1> just like normal Bits, but also
-- in a linear combination of them, in regard with the complex field.
--
-- The two Complex fields represent the coordinates in regard with
-- the {|0>, |1>} basis.
--
-- However, when we mesure the value of a Qubit, we only see one
-- value, drawn at random with a probability being proportional with
-- the module of the coefficients. Then, the value is fixed.
-- I still don't know whether or not I should state if a value is
-- fixed in the Qubit definition. I will see later.
